# Project-Euler
This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a website that offers a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving and programming skills to solve.

## Usage
The repository is structured in a way that each problem has its own directory, containing the solution code and a brief explanation of how the solution was achieved. The code is written in Python, and should be compatible with Python 3.

To run the code for a particular problem, navigate to its directory and run the following command:

```
python problem_000.py
```

## Contributing
If you have a better solution to a problem, or if you found an error in one of my solutions, feel free to open a pull request with your changes. I'm always looking to improve my code and learn new techniques!
